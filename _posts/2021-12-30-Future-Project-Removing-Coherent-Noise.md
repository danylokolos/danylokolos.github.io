This is a future project of mine. I have an idea of how to remove coherent noise from time series data using machine learning. My original inspiration came from observing surface noise on nearby seismic channels, but this technique could work in other situations as well. I am currently looking for a dataset to test my theories. If you have a dataset that you can share, please let me know.
