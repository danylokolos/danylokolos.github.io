# **Problem**

Predicting construction timelines is a difficult task, which heavily relies on user experience and estimates. The timelines are required to be accurate, so that construction material, personnel planning, and other tasks can be coordinated and costs reduced. Automating the prediction task, so that even junior project manager could accurately predict timelines, would be inherently useful in future project planning. Additionally, adding a user interface to the prediction and posting it on a website, would allow the application to be accessed by anyone anywhere, adding to its usefulness. 



# **Methodology**

Working with our client and stakeholders, we defined the scope of the project. It would include developing an application to predict construction timelines. The application would need to be easily accessible anywhere, and simple to use. 

Completing a preliminary search of comparable software that already exists in the world. The search yielded many project planning services which allowed users to input custom completion times and organize projects, but none actually predicted the time for a task. 

Available data to use in building a machine learning model, was provided by the client. It consisted of historical projects, with each project broken down to include: type of transformation, description, quantities, and units.

Some new features were generated to better enable the use of text in the mocahine learning model. Other steps included data wrangling, data pre-processing, splitting the dataset, evaluation and optimization. 

The model was integrated into a web based app. 

Additional features that were added to the solution included: 
* Predicting unit type
* Error handling
* Allowing for Multiple Consecutive Tasks
* Spell Check
* Search for String Matches

... Rest of the write-up still to be completed...
