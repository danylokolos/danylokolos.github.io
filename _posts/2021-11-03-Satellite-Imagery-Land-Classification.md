Classifying land types from satellite imagery using Machine Learning.    

---

# **Part 1: Problem**

Differentiating land types from imagery and storing it in a database can be a time consuming task. Although, a human can quickly recognize which areas are urban, farmland, forest, water, etc., converting that knowledge into a digital file will take considerable time. I realized this task could be accomplished much faster if I utilized some machine learning. 

# **Part 2: Methodology**

To solve the problem at hand, I went to grab some data from an open source satellite imagery dataset: [https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/sentinelplayground/](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/explore/sentinelplayground/). If you've never played around with satellite imagery, the website provides lots of useful and interesting capabilities. Imagery is continuously updated, and the resolution is decent for large scale analysis. 

Selecting an area around Calgary proved interesting, as many different land types could be visible. I made sure to download all 12 bands of data. Remote sensing data is often imaged in EM bands in the visible spectrum (ie. red, green, blue), as well as outside the visible spectrum (into infrared and also slightly towards ultraviolet).
